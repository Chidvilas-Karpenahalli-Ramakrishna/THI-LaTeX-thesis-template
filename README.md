# THI-LaTeX-thesis-template (English)
![](./images/thiRGB.jpg)

This is a repository for students who wish to write their thesis at THI in LaTeX. The current format is for students who wish to write their thesis in English. The LaTeX files are designed in a modular fashion to facilitate students to write their thesis with ease. The repository and it's contents will be updated as and when I get more feedback from thesis students.

# Credits:
This particular thesis template is thanks to Prof. Dr. Andreas Riener at THI. An updated version of the template is obtained from my good friend Mr. Sai Sharath [logicatcore](https://github.com/logicatcore/THI-LaTeX-thesis-template) where he updates the packages and rearranges the contents and provides user-instructions to start with the thesis. The present version that you see is a modified version of the above mentioned templates.

My contributions are:
1. Addition of updated packages
2. Structuring the thesis template to suit the students who wish to write their thesis in English by removing unnecessary and redundant files
3. Addition of better examples within the thesis to highlight how images, equations(complex and simple) and tables can be added and referenced.

Please feel free to restructure your thesis according to your needs. The template offers this flexibility. All the best!
